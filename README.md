# DecimalAddition
This snippet uses String format to add numbers instead of dedicated Integer or Double types (Swift Version)
# Decimal Addition v0.1
We already know that computers use predefined calculation types to use mathemathical operations. for example, addition of two numbers take place in 8,16 or 64 bit memory allocations using binary operations. Every decimal number will be converted to binary numbers first. 
#
In this project, we defined a class with multiple methods and initializers (constructors), to use addition operation in decimal format. For this reason, the app recieves two string text like "xxxxx.xxxxx" and all of the operations will be done in string format. </br>
This code has two main public method that can be called using an instance. </br>
Here are the main methods and their respective examples.
# AddTwoStringsAsNumbers_Comprehensive
this method recieves two string inputs and adds them together and returns a string as the result. </br>
Example : AddTwoStringsAsNumbers_Comprehensive("11.22","22.11")
will return --> "33.33"
# AddTwoStringsAsNumbers
this method only can add two numbers without any decimal part like "11" and "22
